# legacy-mars-global-climate-model
We present the NASA Ames Legacy Mars Global Climate Model for public release. This model uses a modified version of the ARIES/GEOS dynamical core coupled with a set of Mars physics packages to simulate the martian climate. The physics packages include the treatment of surface properties, a ground temperature model, a planetary boundary layer scheme, water and carbon dioxide sublimation/condensation physics, a water ice cloud microphysical scheme, the use of a moment method for tracer transport, a semi-interactive dust tracking scheme, and a two-stream radiative transfer code based on correlated-kâ€™s.
